# SimulatedAnnealing

This is a pure Java trial of a Simulated Annealing Algorithm and it is implemented for searching the optimal value of "Z" function. The global optimal value of Z is -1.0316. 
It is possible to find a close value to global optimum by tweaking annealing schedules, initial points( X and Y) or stopping criterias.
