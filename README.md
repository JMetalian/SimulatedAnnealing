# Implementation of Simulated Annealing Algorithm on Optimization Problem

This is a project is a Simulated Annealing Algorithm implementation purely written in Java and it is implemented for searching the optimal value of "Z" in the given function. The global optimal value of Z is "-1.0316" which is known already. By using SAA, we try to approach to global maximum with approximation.

It is possible to find a close value to global optimum by tweaking annealing schedules, initial points  (X and Y) or stopping criterias.

The mathematical formula is given as below:
